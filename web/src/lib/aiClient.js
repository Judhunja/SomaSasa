## What is ${lessonTopic}?

${lessonTopic} is an important concept in mathematics. Let's learn by doing!

## Let's Solve Together!

### Problem 1: Let's Start Simple
**Question**: If you have 3 mangoes and your friend gives you 2 more mangoes, how many mangoes do you have in total?

**Let's solve this step by step:**

Step 1: Count what you started with
- I have 3 mangoes
- I can picture them: ü•≠ ü•≠ ü•≠

Step 2: Count what you received
- My friend gave me 2 more mangoes
- That's: ü•≠ ü•≠

Step 3: Count them all together
- All my mangoes: ü•≠ ü•≠ ü•≠ ü•≠ ü•≠
- Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- **Answer: 5 mangoes**

### Problem 2: Your Turn to Try!
**Question**: You have 7 pencils. You give 3 pencils to your classmate. How many pencils do you have left?

**Let's work through this:**

Step 1: Start with what you have
- I have 7 pencils: ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è

Step 2: Take away what you gave
- I gave away 3 pencils
- Cross out 3: ~~‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è~~ ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è

Step 3: Count what's left
- Remaining pencils: ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è ‚úèÔ∏è
- Count them: 1, 2, 3, 4
- **Answer: 4 pencils**

### Problem 3: Challenge Time!
**Question**: A matatu has 14 seats. 9 people are already sitting. How many more people can sit?

**Solution walkthrough:**

Step 1: Understand what we know
- Total seats = 14
- People already sitting = 9
- We need to find: How many more can sit?

Step 2: Set up the problem
- This is subtraction: 14 - 9 = ?

Step 3: Solve step by step
- Start with 14
- Take away 9
- 14 - 9 = 5
- **Answer: 5 more people can sit**

## Now You Try!
Practice with objects around you - count stones, bottle tops, or anything you can find!`,

    };
  } else if (subject.toLowerCase().includes('english')) {
    return {
      success: true,
      message: `# ${lessonTopic}

## Learning ${lessonTopic} Through Practice

Let's practice ${lessonTopic} by working through real examples together!

## Example 1: Let's Break It Down

**Sentence**: "The big brown dog ran quickly to the park."

**Let's identify ${lessonTopic} step by step:**

Step 1: Read the sentence carefully
- "The big brown dog ran quickly to the park."

Step 2: Look for the key words
- Let me underline the important parts
- "The **big brown** dog ran **quickly** to the park."

Step 3: Understand what each word does
- "big" and "brown" describe the dog
- "quickly" describes how the dog ran
- These are describing words!

## Example 2: Your Turn to Find Them!

**Sentence**: "The small red car moved slowly down the busy street."

**Let's work together:**

Step 1: Read it out loud
- "The small red car moved slowly down the busy street."

Step 2: Ask yourself - which words describe things?
- What kind of car? ‚Üí small, red
- How did it move? ‚Üí slowly  
- What kind of street? ‚Üí busy

Step 3: Circle the describing words
- The **small red** car moved **slowly** down the **busy** street.

## Example 3: Make Your Own!

**Let's create a sentence:**

Step 1: Pick a thing (noun)
- Let's choose: "bird"

Step 2: Add describing words
- What kind of bird? ‚Üí "beautiful yellow"
- How does it move? ‚Üí "gracefully"

Step 3: Put it together
- "The beautiful yellow bird flew gracefully."

## Practice Activity
Look around your room. Can you describe 3 things you see using describing words?`,

    return {
      success: true,
      message: `# ${lessonTopic}

## Discovering ${lessonTopic} Through Investigation

Let's learn ${lessonTopic} by doing a real investigation together!

## Investigation 1: Let's Observe and Learn

**Question**: Why do some things float and others sink?

**Let's investigate step by step:**

Step 1: Gather materials (things you can find at home)
- A bowl of water
- A stone
- A piece of wood
- A coin
- A plastic bottle cap

Step 2: Make predictions
- Before we test, let's guess:
- Stone: Will it float or sink? (Write your guess)
- Wood: Will it float or sink? (Write your guess)
- Coin: Will it float or sink? (Write your guess)

Step 3: Test each item
- Put the stone in water ‚Üí What happened? (It sank!)
- Put the wood in water ‚Üí What happened? (It floated!)
- Put the coin in water ‚Üí What happened? (It sank!)

Step 4: Look for patterns
- What do you notice?
- Heavy things like stone and coin ‚Üí sink
- Light things like wood ‚Üí float

## Investigation 2: Let's Solve a Problem

**Problem**: Your plant is wilting. What could be wrong?

**Let's think like scientists:**

Step 1: Observe carefully
- Look at the plant
- Are the leaves droopy?
- Is the soil dry or wet?
- Is it getting sunlight?

Step 2: Ask questions
- When did you last water it?
- Is it in a sunny or dark place?
- Are there any bugs on it?

Step 3: Form a hypothesis (educated guess)
- If the soil is dry ‚Üí Maybe it needs water
- If it's in a dark corner ‚Üí Maybe it needs sunlight
- If leaves are yellow ‚Üí Maybe too much water

Step 4: Test your solution
- Try watering it (if soil is dry)
- Move it to sunlight (if it's too dark)
- Wait and observe what happens

## Your Turn to Investigate!
Find something in nature around you and ask "How does this work?" Then investigate!`,

## Learning ${lessonTopic} Step by Step

Let's learn ${lessonTopic} by working through real examples together!

## Example 1: Breaking It Down

**Let's understand ${lessonTopic} by doing it:**

Step 1: Start with what we know
- ${lessonTopic} is important in ${subject}
- Let's see it in action

Step 2: Work through an example
- Here's a simple case of ${lessonTopic}
- Let's solve it together step by step

Step 3: Practice what we learned
- Now you try the same method
- Follow the same steps

## Example 2: Your Turn to Try

**Problem to solve:**

Step 1: Read the problem carefully
- What is being asked?
- What information do we have?

Step 2: Plan your approach
- What steps should we take?
- What do we need to do first?

Step 3: Work through the solution
- Let's do this together
- One step at a time

Step 4: Check our answer
- Does this make sense?
- Can we verify it?

üìö Study Tips:
1. Break big topics into smaller parts
2. Practice regularly, even just 15 minutes a day
3. Ask questions when you don't understand
4. Connect new learning to things you already know

üìù Remember: Every student learns differently, and that's perfectly fine! 

Try rephrasing your question or asking about a specific part you'd like help with. I'll do my best to guide you!

Keep learning and stay curious! üåü`,
